# ACM-Team-Notebook

ACM Team Notebook is a reference material that can be carried by the teams for the onsite contest.
This notebook contains commonly used algorithms, code snippets, cheatsheets and conceptual implementation for ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. 


### About ACM
The ICPC, entitled the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. The contest is sponsored by IBM. Headquartered at Baylor University, directed by ICPC Executive Director and Baylor Professor William B. Poucher, the ICPC operates in autonomous regions on six continents under the auspices of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in accordance with the ICPC Policies and Procedures which are published at the [Official ICPC Headquarters Website](https://icpc.baylor.edu/).
